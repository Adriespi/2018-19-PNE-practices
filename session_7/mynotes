#Here's were I'll take my notes for the 7th session#

Client-server model:
The client starts the communication (request). The server generates a message with the response . There can be multiple clients following the same scheme.
When there's no client, nothing happens, the server is constantly running and 'listening' to requests. However, when there's no server, nothing can work. We first
have to run the server and check if everything's ok.

This programs all run inside computers (general term: phones, tablets and many other devices). To test the client-server communication, it's possible to have 1 computer running
the client and the server in the same computer.

Client and server are connected by the internet
