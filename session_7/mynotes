#Here's were I'll take my notes for the 7th session#

Client-server model:
The client starts the communication (request). The server generates a message with the response . There can be multiple clients following the same scheme.
When there's no client, nothing happens, the server is constantly running and 'listening' to requests. However, when there's no server, nothing can work. We first
have to run the server and check if everything's ok.

This programs all run inside computers (general term: phones, tablets and many other devices). To test the client-server communication, it's possible to have 1 computer running
the client and the server in the same computer.

Client and server are connected through the internet. In the internet there are isolated computers connected with each other and divided in groups or 'networks'. If we want to send
a message from the client(in one computer) to the server (in another computer) we need to identify it first. This is called the IP ADRESS. This refers to the interface, which means
that one computer can have multiple ip address (the server) and the client only has one. This ip can change depending on the computer you are connected to.

F.E: my ip address when connected to wireless urjc: 10.0.48.141
     the computer in the lab's ip address is 212.128.253.113
     The teacher's computer's ip address is 212.128.253.64

The command 'ping' is just for sending a message to the computer to check if the computer is 'alive' in the internet
To execute it just type 'ping' following the ip address you want to check in the terminal
each line appearing in the terminal is a message showing, for example, the time it took the command to be received and return.

***Example of ping times for 8.8.8.8***
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=121 time=9.03 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=121 time=3.27 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=121 time=3.45 ms

***Example of ping times for 212.128.253.113 (computer lab)***
64 bytes from 212.128.253.113: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.061 ms
64 bytes from 212.128.253.113: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.056 ms
64 bytes from 212.128.253.113: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.063 ms


The ping you make to your own computer is always going to be smaller

URL----> universal resource locator-----> it's for identifying a computer interface adapted for humans. Each url has an ip address.
The first thing a browser does is getting the ip adress corresponding to the url you just typed
google's ip ----> 216.58.214.164

To connect to a server connected anywhere in the internet we need the ip address.

The port is a number that identifies any of the available applications in a computer. So if we want to connect to a server we need to specify the ip adress of the machine and the
port you wish to use
